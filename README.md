## BackGround

During my full-stack bootcamp at Appleseeds, in groups of 6 we participated in a 24 hours hackathon that was hosted by the course.

The project idea we chose, is a website for kids stories and fairy tales, allowing selecting stories from different cultures and backgrounds, and to read them in a preffered language!

### Goal

Our purpose is to connect and share each other's wisdom in our cultures and fairy tales, allowing an easy, fun and new experience, beside the one's that are already present and we already know in our community.
