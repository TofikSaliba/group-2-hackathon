                    As part of our group project, we have contemplated a lot
                    about what should be an outstanding but also a beneficial
                    notion of a website that could serve parents as well as
                    children, and can be of a great effect on their daily lives.
                    Reading bedtime Stories is one of the most interesting and
                    important activities parents and their children share
                    worldwide, as parents from all over the world read their
                    children a story while the later listen eagerly and
                    passionately to it. In addition, we desire in merging
                    cultures and people by exposing children to various
                    languages along teaching for tolerance and accepting others.
                    Therefore, we have created "Follow your tale" - an engaging
                    and interactive website for extraordinary experience for
                    both parents and children.
